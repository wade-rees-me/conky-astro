  "Altitude(Alt)": "Vertical angle above the horizon, from 0° (horizon) to 90° (zenith or directly overhead)",
  "Azimuth(Az)": "Compass direction along the horizon: 0° = North, 90° = East, 180° = South, 270° = West",
  "Right Ascension(RA)": "Celestial equivalent of longitude, measured in hours: 0h to 24h around the sky",
  "Declination(Dec)": "Celestial equivalent of latitude, from –90° (south celestial pole) to +90° (north celestial pole)",
